# Logistic-Regression
  Logistic regression is a predictive model and it is used when my Target Variable is Catgorical Variable/Discreat Variable
•	Prepared data quality report to understand the dataset, removed variables having more than 20% missing values, eliminated variables based on variable profiling. 
•	Treated the missing values in continuous variables by mean imputation, combined levels for missing values in categorical variables and treated outliers by mean imputation. 
•	Built a logistic regression model based on backward selection algorithm, eliminated non-significant variables, finalized the model after several iterations, tested the model using ROCR and AUC score and identified the customers with high probability of churn
•	Completed the objective by arriving at top 5 factors that influenced the churn behavior and provided recommendations based on the results obtained from the model.
